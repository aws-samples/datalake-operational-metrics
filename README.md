## Introduction

Over the last number of years, enterprises have accumulated so much of data. Data volumes have increased at an unprecedented rate,
exploding from terabytes to petabytes and sometimes exabytes of data. Increasingly many enterprises are building highly scalable, 
available, secure, and flexible Data Lakes on AWS, that can handle extremely large data sets. Once data lakes are productionized, 
to measure the efficacy of the data lake and communicate the gaps or accomplishments to the business groups, enterprise data teams 
are looking for tools to extract operational insights from the data lake solution. 
Those insights help answer key questions such as 
1/ when was the last time a table was updated 
2/ what is the total table count in each of my database 
3/ what is the projected growth of a given table 
4/what is the most frequently queried table vs least queried tables etc.

In this post, I will walk you through a solution to build operational metrics dashboard for your enterprise data catalog on AWS.
